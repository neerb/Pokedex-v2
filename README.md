# Pokedex V2

This is the second iteration of my retro-twist-style Pokedex site.  All data is sourced from the PokeAPI and stylizing and responsive nature is completely native CSS.  Some of the animations are sourced React libraries and their components (such as Fade).

## Installation

It's a simple create-react-app project, so download and run ```npm install``` for the necessary packages and then execute ```npm start```

### I do hope you enjoy it, try it on your phone as well.  I've tried to design it such that it feels like you're holding a real Pokedex in your hands.
